# ML-For-Dummies
ML for dummies, by a dummy. I am learning ML and as such I am documenting everything that I do in a way that makes sense and isn't complex at all.
## How do I make sense of this?
Well its kinda a do as you wish sorta thing but personally I would start by reading the scripts for all the ML, understanding them (super noted and it is beginner friendly). Then I'd say go to DL scripts. The DL notes are like super great and I want to add more stuff so if you know a lot about ai please help make this project better.
